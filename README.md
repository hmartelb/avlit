Audio-Visual Lightweight ITerative model (AVLIT) uses the [A-FRCNN](https://github.com/JusperLee/AFRCNN-For-Speech-Separation) as building block. 
AVLIT employs a homogeneous design with audio and video branches composed of A-FRCNN blocks used iteratively. The weights are shared for each modality, making the number of parameters constant. Please refer to the paper for details.

## Quick start

### Installation

Make sure to have ``pytorch`` with GPU support installed on your machine according to the [official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Basic usage

Here is a minimal example of how to use AVLIT in plain Pytorch. The default parameters will produce the configuration for AVLIT-8, which is the best performing model in the paper.

```python
from src.avlit import AVLIT

# Instantiate the model
model = AVLIT(
    num_sources = 2,
    # Audio branch
    audio_num_blocks = 8,
    # Video branch
    video_num_blocks = 4,
    video_encoder_checkpoint = "path/to/ae.ckpt",
)
model.cuda()

# Training or inference logic here
# ...

```

### Advanced usage

For more control over the architecture, it is possible to provide values for more parameters as follows:

```python
from src.avlit import AVLIT

# Instantiate the model
model = AVLIT(
    num_sources = 2,
    # Audio branch
    kernel_size = 40,
    audio_hidden_channels = 512,
    audio_bottleneck_channels = 128,
    audio_num_blocks = 8,
    audio_states = 5,
    # Video branch
    video_hidden_channels = 128,
    video_bottleneck_channels = 128,
    video_num_blocks = 4,
    video_states = 5,
    video_encoder_checkpoint = "path/to/ae.ckpt",
    video_encoder_trainable = False,
    video_embedding_dim = 1024,
    # AV fusion
    fusion_operation = "sum",
    fusion_positions = [4],
)
model.cuda()

# Training or inference logic here
# ...

```

### Tests
The [tests/](https://github.com/hmartelb/avlit/blob/main/tests) folder contains unit tests for the AVLIT architecture. 
It is useful to run these tests if you want to customize the configuration parameters to verify that the input/output shapes are as expected and that the model can perform a forward pass correctly on CPU/GPU.  

To run all the unit tests, make sure to install the ``pytest`` package and run:
```
pytest tests/test_models.py 
```
